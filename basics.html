    <h2>Variables</h2>

        // This is a single line comment in JavaScript
        /* This is a multiline comment in JavaScript */ 

        // let's create our first variable
        var firstName = "Rae";
        console.log("the value of our first name variable is: " + firstName);

        // create the variable, set it to an empty string;
        // we will give it a value later
        var lastName = "";

        // DO NOT USE THIS METHOD
        middleName = "Elizabeth";

    </script>

    <h2>Functions</h2>

    <script>
         // this is a JavaScript function definition; we need to use the keyword function
        // functions are awesome - you write code 1 time and can reuse it throughout your program
        // functions help to organize the code
        // function names should usually be some sort of action
        // always include the () - sometimes there will be variable(s) in between the () or they may be empty
        // always make sure there are a matching set of curly braces { } 
        function runCalc(){ // do not mix ; and {}
            // whatever code is in between the curly braces belongs to this function
            // we will create a variable called num1, and we will give it a default value of 0
            // JavaScript should assume that this is a numberic datatype
            var num1 = 0;
            var num2 = 0;

            // we want to prompt the user for a number, using the built in JavaScript prompt function
            // the prompt function takes an argument (variable) - the text that wil be shown to the user with the prompt
            // the prompt function returns the value that the user entered in
            // set the num1 variable equal to the value the user entered in
            
            // do while loop will run at least 1 time, and then can run as 
            // many times as needed; while loops may run 0 times
            do{
                // make the user enter a number; this loop will run until a number 
                // is entered
                num1 = prompt("Please enter number 1: "); //most lines of JavaScript need a ; at the end     
            // if isNotaNumber is true (they entered text) or the user entered 0
            // the loop will keep running
            }while(isNaN(num1) || num1 == 0); // this ; is mandatory            
            
            // get another number from the user and assign it to the num2 variable
            //num2 = prompt("Please enter number 2: "); //most lines of JavaScript need a ; at the end

            // let's add num1 and num2 together and store that value in the total variable
            // The build in JavaScript function parseInt makes sure that JavaScript treats the num1 and num2 variables as integers (whole numbers)
            var total = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2);

            // call the built in JavaScript function called alert - this will show a message to the user
            // it should show our numbers and the total
            //alert("The total of " + num1 + " plus " + num2 + " is " + total);
        }

        // we have created the function, now we need to call it so that the function code will run
        //the () are blank because we don't need to pass any information into this function
        //runCalc();

        //the code here does not belong to the function
    </script>

    <h2>Decision Logic (if/else)</h2>

    <script>
      //creating a variable called age with a default value of 5
      // 1 equal sign is assignment, the variable on the left is assigned the 
      // value on the right
      var age = 7;

      // 2 equal signs mean check for equality, or does the value on the left side
      // match the value on the right side
      // if statement, test a value, if the test results in true, run the if block of code
      if (age == 5){
        // this code will run if the value of the age variable is 5
        //alert("age=" + age);
      }
      // else if will be checked when the if statement does not evaluate to true
      else if (age == 6){
        // this code will run if the value of the age variable is 6
        //alert("age=" + age);
      }
      // the else statement is a catch-all, it will run if none of the if/else if 
      // statements are true
      else{
         // this code will run if the value of the age variable is anything other than
         // 5 or 6
         //alert("age was not 5 or 6");
      }

    </script>

    <h2>Loops</h2>

    <script>
        // loops run code repeatedly
        // they are great for displaying data
        // there are 2 basic types of loops - for loop and while loop

        // We are going to create an infinite loop bug
        var count = 0;

        // set up a while loop, we want it to run until the counter hits 5
        while(count <= 5){
            
            // do whatever thing this loop needs
            console.log("count=" + count);

            // change the value of our counter
            // count++ is the same thing as count = count + 1
            // count-- is the same thing as count = count - 1
            count++;
        }

        // for loops are generally used when you know how many times you want
        // the code to run
        // 1st part of our for loop is a counter variable, and we are setting it 
        // to a default value of 0
        // 2nd part the condition that the for loop will test on each run 
        // the loop will run as long as this condition is true
        // 3rd part is incrementing the counter variable each time the loop runs
        // i++ is the same thing as i = i + 1
        for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++){
            //alert("i=" + i);
        }

        // counter variable, set to default value of 0
        var counter = 0;
        // while loop will run until the counter is equal to 5
        while(counter < 5){
            //display the value of counter in an alert
            //alert("counter=" + counter);

            //increase the value of counter by 1 every time the while loop runs
            counter++;
        }

        // while loops are generally used when you do not know how many times you 
        // want the code to run
